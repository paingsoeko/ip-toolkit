## ‚ú® Features

*   **Public IP Detection:** Instantly finds and displays your public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
*   **Local IP Detection:** Uses WebRTC to discover and show your local network IP address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).
*   **Detailed Geolocation:** Provides comprehensive location information, including city, region, country, and postal code.
*   **Interactive Map:** Visually pinpoints your IP's approximate location on a dynamic, dark-themed map powered by Leaflet.js.
*   **Network Information:** Displays your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and hostname.
*   **Modern & Responsive UI:** Features a sleek "glassmorphism" design that looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
*   **Tabbed Interface:** Organizes complex information into clean "Overview" and "Details" tabs for a better user experience.
*   **Clickable Details:** Allows you to click on your ISP, hostname, or location to perform a quick web search or view it on Google Maps.
*   **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy your IP addresses with a single click.
*   **Skeleton Loading UI:** Implements a modern placeholder UI that appears while data is being fetched, improving perceived performance.
*   **SEO Optimized:** Includes structured data (JSON-LD) and descriptive metadata to improve visibility on search engines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** CSS3 with custom properties for theming and a responsive grid/flexbox layout.
*   **Mapping:** [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
*   **APIs:**
    *   [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) for public IP address retrieval.
    *   [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) for geolocation and network details.
*   **Local IP Detection:** WebRTC (`RTCPeerConnection` API).
*   **Build/Module System:** ES Modules with an `importmap` for browser-based dependency management.
