# IP & Network Toolkit

A modern, feature-rich web application designed to provide detailed insights into your network connection. This tool fetches and displays your public IPv4/IPv6 addresses, local IP, geolocation data, ISP, hostname, and more in a professional, dark-themed interface.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Public IP Detection:** Instantly finds and displays your public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

*   **Detailed Geolocation:** Provides comprehensive location information, including city, region, country, and postal code.
*   **Interactive Map:** Visually pinpoints your IP's approximate location on a dynamic, dark-themed map powered by Leaflet.js.

*   **Comprehensive Network Tools:**
    *   **Download Speed Test:** Measure your connection's download bandwidth against Cloudflare's network.
    *   **Latency Test:** Ping major services like Google, Cloudflare, and GitHub to check network latency.
    *   **DNS Lookup:** Retrieve common DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, NS, CNAME) for any domain.
    *   **WHOIS Lookup:** Get public registration data for any domain or IP address using RDAP.
*   **System Information:** Shows details about your browser, OS, screen resolution, and more.
